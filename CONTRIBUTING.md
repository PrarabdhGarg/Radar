## Getting started
- Fork the repository.
- Select an issue to work on. If you are contributing for the first time, issues tagged `good-first-issue` might be a great place to get started.
- Create a Pull Request after solving the issue.

## Working on issues
- Please don't start working on an issue unless it is assigned to you. If you want to work on a specific issue that is currently not assigned to anyone, you can simply comment on the issue and one of the maintainers will assign the issue to you.
- Issues are labeled with various tags which might help you in finding issues best-suited for you. The labels convey information regarding the difficulty of the issue, the estimated time required to solve the issue, and other relevent information.
- You can find a list of all the tags and their meanings at the end of this document.

## Creating an issue
- Before creating an issue, make sure that a similar issue does not exist already.
- Issues that you create could be related to anything from a bug in the codebase to the proposal for an entire feature.
- Make sure to add appropriate labels to the issue so that it would be easier for everyone to get a gist of what the issue is.
- By default, a new issue is assigned to the person who created the issue. However, if you are not interested in working on an issue you created, let us know in the comments and we will assign it to someone else.
- For issues that describe a new feature to be introduced, please try to elaborate on why the feature might be useful and how we can go about implementing it. If you are unsure, the slack channel might be a great place to discuss.
